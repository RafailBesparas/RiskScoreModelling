### Note: This project is under refinement and I need to optimize and clean the code. Also I want to make it reusable and functional

# Project Title
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to assess the likelihood of borrowers defaulting on loans. By leveraging synthetic data and machine learning algorithms, the goal is to evaluate how various factors contribute to loan defaults and determine the most accurate and interpretable model for making predictions.

# Explanation
Default risk is the risk that a borrower (such as an individual, company, or government entity) will fail to meet the obligations of a loan or debt agreement, meaning they might miss interest payments, principal repayments, or both.

# Next Steps
Utilize transfer learning and my model to compare the behavior of other datasets related to default risk.

# The project uses a dataset with synthetic yet realistic features commonly seen in financial datasets, such as:
Age
Annual Income
Debt-to-Income Ratio
Loan Amount
Credit Score
Payment History
Previous Loan Defaults
Bankruptcy History

# Objectives:
1. Feature Engineering: Simulate and preprocess data that captures the characteristics influencing default risk.

# Model Benchmarking: Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   
# Performance Metrics: 
Compare models based on precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to identify the most suitable algorithm.

# XGBoost Evaluation: 
Highlight the performance of XGBoost by testing it on synthetic data, demonstrating its ability to handle structured data and non-linear relationships.
